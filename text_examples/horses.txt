Evolutionary History

The evolution of horses is well-documented through fossil remains, showing how a small, dog-sized forest-dwelling animal—Hyracotherium, with toes instead of hooves—transformed over 50 million years into large, hoofed inhabitants of open spaces. Most speciation occurred in North America, from where they migrated to Eurasia via a natural land bridge when the Bering Strait was absent and before the formation of a massive ice sheet.

The evolution of horses began in the Eocene, about 55 million years ago. At that time, Hyracotherium—a precursor to all modern horses—was a small creature with a shoulder height of just 20 cm, chewing leaves and fruits with its small teeth. Hyracotherium bore little resemblance to today's horses. This stocky, fox-sized animal had a curved back, short neck and muzzle, short legs, and a long tail, with four-toed limbs. Its skull and brain volume were relatively small.

About 50 million years ago, the genus Orohippus emerged from Hyracotherium. Its limbs and teeth changed, as Orohippus preferred harder plant food. Three million years later, Orohippus evolved into the genus Epihippus. Meanwhile, the climate changed significantly, becoming drier in North America, with forests shrinking and giving way to open savannas. This was a key event in horse evolution, forcing them to adapt to new conditions. They grew larger, enabling faster movement, and fully switched to a grass-based diet.

Around 40 million years ago, the genus Mesohippus formed. This horse stood about 60 cm at the shoulder, with a straighter back than its ancestors and longer legs, neck, and muzzle. Its hoof structure also changed. About 35 million years ago, it transitioned into the genus Miohippus, with representatives growing larger and their muzzles lengthening further.

Around 23 million years ago, the genus Parahippus arose. This animal had more adapted teeth and only three hoofed toes per foot. Descendants of Parahippus included the genus Merychippus, which reached up to one meter at the shoulder. Their skulls began to resemble those of modern horses, and their brain volume increased significantly. The genus Merychippus split into several evolutionary lines, some of which went extinct. After an intermediate link called Dinohippus, around 4.4–4.5 million years ago (according to geneticists), the Equus lineage emerged, giving rise to all modern horses, zebras, and donkeys. About 2.5 million years ago, Equus members crossed from America to Eurasia via Beringia. In the Middle East, they became donkeys, onagers, and true horses (Equus caballus), while in Central Africa, they evolved into zebras.

The lineage leading to modern domesticated horses (DOM2) diverged from the Przewalski's horse line 43,800 years ago and from the Lena horse (Equus lensensis) line 118,600 years ago, according to genomic data. The extinct Lena horse spread to South Siberia. After analyzing principal component analysis (PCA), phylogenetic, and f3-outgroup clustering, it was found that the MerzlyYar_Rus45_23789 sample from the Republic of Tuva (Merzly Yar site in the upper reaches of the Bolshoy Yenisei River) dated to 24,000 years ago carries highly divergent mitochondrial DNA, also found on the New Siberian Islands around 33,200 years ago.

Horses went extinct in North America by the mid-6th millennium BCE, before being reintroduced during European colonization in the 16th century with domestic horses and donkeys. Feral populations of introduced horses became known as mustangs. A similar process occurred in Australia, where no horse genus representatives existed prior to this.
